# Notes

This file is used to record what I've learnt during the process of building this application

## Server

- require
  When we do "const var = require('some package')", the node will try to look for the node_modules with the folder name and the entry file for the folder (normally it's a index.js file). We can find this main file by looking into the package.json file and search for "main"
